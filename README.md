### Our repository has 2 jupyter notebook files in it (excluding this file). The notebook called top10 has the top 10 incident types in zip code 10001 during 2020. The second file called Parking analyzes whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total incidents in 10001 compared to the rest of the data (in general).
